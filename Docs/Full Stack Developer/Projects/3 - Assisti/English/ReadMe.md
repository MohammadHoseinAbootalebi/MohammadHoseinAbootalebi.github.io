#### Authentication & Authorization

To create a robust and scalable backend with a focus on extensibility and security, the Assisti backend was developed using the powerful Django framework and Python programming language. Djangoâ€™s versatility allows for rapid development, while its built-in security features ensure data protection and minimize vulnerabilities. Python's simplicity and efficiency further enhance the backend's performance, making it easier to maintain and expand as the application grows. This combination of technologies ensures that the backend can handle increased user traffic and new feature integrations seamlessly. Additionally, the flexible architecture supports continuous improvements, positioning the Assisti backend for long-term success and adaptability.

##### Assisti Auth User Database Model

To ensure extensibility, a key characteristic envisioned for Assisti, the development of the backend user models was carefully designed with scalability and flexibility in mind. The following base code serves as the foundation for the Assisti user model, allowing for seamless customization and integration of additional features as needed. By implementing a modular architecture, the user model can accommodate future enhancements without disrupting the core functionality. This approach not only simplifies maintenance but also aligns with the project's goal of supporting evolving user requirements. The base code exemplifies this commitment to adaptability and forward-thinking design.

ðŸ“Œ One of my core strengths is writing clean, well-structured, and fully documented code, ensuring readability and ease of understanding for seamless collaboration and future maintenance.

In Django development, extending the user authentication model is best achieved by creating custom user models that inherit from `AbstractBaseUser`. This approach provides greater flexibility for future enhancements and customizations. I have implemented this key feature, ensuring the user model is robust, scalable, and adaptable to evolving project needs. By following this best practice, the backend is better positioned for seamless integration of advanced functionalities. This implementation highlights my focus on building maintainable and forward-thinking solutions.

As demonstrated in the Assisti code above, the `AssistIUser`, a customized Django backend user model, includes the following attributes designed to enhance functionality and adaptability.

* **Email:** This field stores the email addresses of Assisti users, serving as a cornerstone for authentication and authorization processes. Recognized as the "email address" in the admin panel, it is designed to be unique, ensuring every user has an exclusive identifier. Beyond authentication, this email is integral to various platform functionalities, including subscription services, successful payment confirmations, and other critical notifications. Most importantly, it supports secure login through cutting-edge two-factor authentication, where verification codes are sent via emailâ€”a widely adopted standard in modern authentication systems across platforms.
* **Username:** This field is used to store the username, which increases the uniqueness of Assisti users and allows for potential future use cases.
* **Name:** This field displays the names of Assisti users.
* **Date Joined:** This field records the date and time when each Assisti user joined the platform.
* **Is Active:** This field indicates whether an Assisti user's account is active or not.
* **Is Verified:** This field indicates whether an Assisti user has verified their email address.
* **Is Staff:** This field checks whether an Assisti user is a staff member or an employee of Assisti.
* **Two-Factor Code:** This field stores the two-factor authentication code, which enhances Assisti's authentication and authorization system.
* **ID:** This field serves as the unique identifier for each Assisti user.
* **Objects:** This field specifies the customized Assisti manager responsible for user creation and superuser creation processes.
* **Username Field:** This field determines which attribute of the Assisti Auth User model should be used in authentication processes.
* **Required:** This field specifies which attributes of Assisti users are mandatory.

##### Two-Factor Authentication System

To enhance the security of user authentication in the Assisti project, an optional two-factor authentication (2FA) method has been implemented. This approach involves generating a fixed-length random code, which is sent to the user's email address. During the login process, after the user enters his/her email, they are prompted to provide the two-factor authentication code received in their inbox. This additional step ensures that only the rightful owner of the email account can access the system, adding a significant layer of protection to the login process.

###### Backend of Two-Factor Authentication System

To explain the backend implementation of the two-factor authentication system in the AI-driven **Assisti** project, each user has a database field that stores a two-factor authentication code, as shown below:

```python
...
    # Two-factor authentication code field
    two_factor_code = models.CharField(max_length=6, blank=True, null=True)
...
```

This field stores the authentication code generated during login. When a user enters their email and password as credentials, a random six-digit code is generated and sent via email using **Gmail**, which serves as the backend email sender for **Assisti**. The email is sent using the `send_mail` method from the `django.core.mail` package.

After the email is sent, the user is redirected to the **Two-Factor Authentication** view and its corresponding template. Upon entering the received code in the provided form, the code is validated by comparing the userâ€™s input (retrieved from the `POST` request) with the stored code in the database. If the validation is successful, the user is logged in using Djangoâ€™s `login` method from the `django.contrib.auth` package and then redirected to the **Assisti** landing page.

##### Login Process

The most important aspect of the Assisti professional AI-driven project is its authentication and authorization, which serve as its security shield. In this section, user account creation and, most importantly, user account validation will be discussed. With a professionally developed backend, only valid users can gain access and have the opportunity to use Assisti's features and applications. The following explains this procedure, starting with the login process, which is exclusively for users with a valid account. To log in to Assisti in the web view, users should click or tap the 'Login' button, as shown below.

- "Login" Button on the Landing Page (Desktop Web View)

![Login Button on the Landing Page | Desktop Web View](../Assets/Authentication%20and%20Authorization/Landing%20Page%20--%20Assisti%20-%20Web%20--%20Desktop.png)

- "Login" Button on the Landing Page (Mobile Web View and Closed Top Appbar)

- "Login" Button on the Landing Page (Mobile Web View and Opened Top Appbar)

![Login Button on the Landing Page (Mobile Web View and Opened Top Appbar)](../Assets/Authentication%20and%20Authorization/Landing%20Page%20--%20Assisti%20-%20Web%20--%20Mobile%20--%20Not%20Login%20--%20Opened%20Appbar.png)

By clicking or tapping the 'Login' button, the login-view URL name will be requested via an HTTP request. The anchor link for the 'Login' button is shown below.

```html
{% raw %}

...

<li 
  class="nav-item d-xxl-flex justify-content-xxl-center">
    <a 
      class="btn btn-primary d-xxl-flex align-items-xxl-center ms-md-2 mt-2 mb-2 pt-pb-1 pe-3 ps-3 w-100 MuhammadHusainAbootalebi-navbar-button text-white" 
      role="button" 
      href="{% url 'login-view' %}" 
      style="background: rgb(0,8,20);border-style: none;font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">
        Login
    </a>
</li>

...

{% endraw %}
```

The mentioned URL name, login-view, is linked to the login_view viewâ€”which will be explained nextâ€”in the following URL pattern:

```python
...

    path('login/', views.login_view, name='login-view'),

...
```

After clicking or tapping the 'Login' button, the user will be navigated to the login web view, which appears as follows:

- Login Form (Desktop Web View)

![Login Form (Desktop Web View)](../Assets/Authentication%20and%20Authorization/Login%20Form%20--%20Desktop%20Web%20View.png)

- Login Form (Desktop Web View)

![Login Form (Desktop Web View)](../Assets/Authentication%20and%20Authorization/Login%20Form%20--%20Mobile%20Web%20View.png)

The login view above is linked to the `login_view` function, which is explained next.

1. **`def login_view(request):`**

   - Defines the `login_view` function, which handles user login requests.
2. **`if request.method == 'POST':`**

   - Checks if the request method is `POST`, meaning the user has submitted the login form.
3. **`email = request.POST['email']`**

   - Retrieves the email entered by the user from the submitted form data.
4. **`password = request.POST['password']`**

   - Retrieves the password entered by the user from the submitted form data.
5. **`user = authenticate(request, email=email, password=password)`**

   - Calls Djangoâ€™s `authenticate` function to verify if the provided credentials match a registered user.
6. **`if user is not None:`**

   - Checks if authentication was successful. If `user` is not `None`, it means valid credentials were provided.
7. **`user.generate_two_factor_code()`**

   - Calls a method on the user model to generate a two-factor authentication (2FA) code.
8. **`send_mail(...`**

   - Sends an email containing the generated 2FA code to the userâ€™s registered email.
   - **`subject='Your Two-Factor Code',`**

     - Sets the email subject as "Your Two-Factor Code."
   - **`message=f"Your code is {user.two_factor_code}",`**

     - Provides a plain text version of the message containing the 2FA code.
   - **`html_message=f""" ... """`**

     - Defines an HTML-styled email message with an eye-catching design.
     - **Inline styles and Google Fonts:**

       - The email body has a yellow background (`#FFD60A`), center alignment, and padding.
       - Uses Google Fonts (`Roboto`) for a professional look.
     - **Main contents of the email:**

       - A heading (`Your Two-Factor Authentication Code`).
       - A styled block displaying the 2FA code.
       - A note informing the user that the code will expire soon.
   - **`from_email=settings.EMAIL_HOST_USER,`**

     - Specifies the sender's email, retrieved from Djangoâ€™s settings.
   - **`recipient_list=[user.email],`**

     - Sends the email to the authenticated userâ€™s email address.
   - **`fail_silently=False,`**

     - Ensures that an error is raised if the email fails to send.
9. **`return redirect('verify_2fa-view', user_id=user.id)`**

   - Redirects the user to a 2FA verification page after receiving the code.
10. **`else:`**

    - Executes if authentication fails (invalid email or password).
11. **`messages.error(request, "Check your credentials and try again.")`**

    - Displays an error message prompting the user to verify their credentials.
12. **`return redirect('login-view')`**

    - Redirects the user back to the login page if authentication fails.
13. **`return render(request, 'account/login.html')`**

    - If the request method is not `POST`, renders the login page (`login.html`) so users can enter their credentials.

The total `login_view` in a glance likes below:

```python
...

def login_view(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        email = request.POST['email']
        password = request.POST['password']

        # Authenticate user
        user = authenticate(request, email=email, password=password)
        if user is not None:
            # Generate and send 2FA code
            user.generate_two_factor_code()
            send_mail(
                subject='Your Two-Factor Code',
                message=f"Your code is {user.two_factor_code}",
                html_message=f"""
                <html>

                    </body>
                </html>
                """,
                from_email=settings.EMAIL_HOST_USER,  # Replace with your email sender
                recipient_list=[user.email],
                fail_silently=False,
            )
            # Redirect to the 2FA verification page
            return redirect('verify_2fa-view', user_id=user.id)
        else:
            messages.error(request, "Check your credintials and try again.")
            return redirect('login-view')

    return render(request, 'account/login.html')

...
```

After the login credentials are entered and the 'Login' button is clicked or tapped, the user will be navigated to the Two-Factor Authentication web page, which looks like the one below.

- Two-Factor Authentication Screen (Laptop Web View)

##### Signup Process

During the signup process, a new user account is created. This step is intended for users who do not already have an existing account. By completing the signup, they gain access to the platform as registered Assisti users. The system ensures that only new users can proceed with this process to prevent duplicate accounts. Once registered, they can log in and utilize the platformâ€™s features. This marks the beginning of their experience as authenticated Assisti users.

To navigate to the Signup form or web page from the landing page shown below, the "Signup" button should be clicked or tapped.

- "Signup" Button on the Landing Page (Desktop Web View)

By clicking or tapping on the "Signup" button, the URL below will be requested through HTTP.

```HTML
{% raw %}

...

<li 
  class="nav-item d-xxl-flex justify-content-xxl-center me-xl-5">
  <a
    class="btn d-xxl-flex align-items-xxl-center mt-2 mb-2 pt-pb-1 pe-3 ps-3 w-100 MuhammadHusainAbootalebi-navbar-button"
    role="button" 
    href="{% url 'register-view' %}"
    style="background: rgba(255,255,255,0);color: rgb(0,8,20);font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;border-width: 1.8px;border-color: #000814;">
      Signup
  </a>
</li>

...

{% endraw %}
```

As seen above, the "Signup" button is linked to the `register-view` URL name, which has the following URL pattern:

```python
  ...

  path("register/", views.registerView, name="register-view"),

  ...
```

As seen above, the URL pattern is linked to `views.registerView`, whose backend implementation is shown below:

```python
def registerView(request):
```

- Defines a function named `registerView`, which handles user registration. It takes `request` as an argument to process HTTP requests.

```python
    form = AssistIUserCreationForm()
```

- Initializes an empty registration form using the `AssistIUserCreationForm` custom form class. This form will be displayed when the page first loads.

```python
    if request.method == 'POST':
```

- Checks if the form submission method is `POST`, meaning the user has submitted the registration form.

```python
        form = AssistIUserCreationForm(request.POST)
```

- Creates a new instance of `AssistIUserCreationForm`, now populated with the data submitted by the user.

```python
        if form.is_valid():
```

- Validates the form data to ensure it meets the defined requirements (e.g., valid email, password strength, unique username).

```python
            # Save the new user
            form.save()
```

- Saves the new user to the database, officially creating their account.

```python
            # Provide a success message
            messages.success(request, 'Account created successfully.')
```

- Displays a success message to inform the user that their account has been created successfully.

```python
            # Redirect to the login page or any other page
            return redirect('login-view')  # Adjust to your actual login URL name
```

- Redirects the user to the login page (`login-view`), ensuring they can log in immediately after signing up.

```python
    else:
        form = AssistIUserCreationForm()
```

- If the request is not a `POST` request (meaning the user is just visiting the page), an empty form instance is created and displayed.

```python
    context = {
        'form': form
    }
```

- Creates a `context` dictionary that contains the form, which will be passed to the template for rendering.

```python
    return render(request, 'account/register.html', context)
```

- Renders the `register.html` template, passing in the form so users can fill it out and register.

The entire code at a glance looks like the one below:

```python
...

def registerView(request):
  
    form = AssistIUserCreationForm()
  
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = AssistIUserCreationForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            # Save the new user
            form.save()
            # Provide a success message
            messages.success(request, 'Account created successfully.')
            # Redirect to the login page or any other page
            return redirect('login-view')  # Adjust to your actual login URL name
    else:
        form = AssistIUserCreationForm()
  
    context = {
        'form': form
    }
  
    return render(request, 'account/register.html', context)

...
```

After the user navigates to the registration template, a page like the one below can be seen on both large and small screens:

- Signup Screen (Large Web View)

![Signup Screen (Large Web View)](../Assets/Authentication%20and%20Authorization/Signup%20Screen%20-%20Large%20Web%20View.png)

- Signup Screen (Small Web View)

![Signup Screen (Small Web View)](../Assets/Authentication%20and%20Authorization/Signup%20Screen%20-%20Small%20Web%20View.png)

After the account is successfully created, the user will be navigated to the login screen by the `return redirect('login-view')` code in order to use their new credentials to validate their account and authenticate in the Assisti authentication system. And a successful message will be shown to the user as shown below. Additionally an welcome email will be sent to the used email for registration for more user intractivity as whown below.

- Account Creation Success Message (Large Screen View)

#### Artificial Intelligence Development & Architecture

##### Overview Workflow

In this section, I will provide an overview of the backend development for the Assisti project, focusing on its views, URL routing, and template integration. The views in Django serve as the logic layer, processing user requests and returning appropriate responses, while the URL routing connects these views to specific endpoints, enabling seamless navigation across the application. Additionally, the templates form the bridge between the backend and frontend, rendering dynamic content for the user interface. Each component plays a critical role in ensuring the functionality and responsiveness of the Assisti AI-driven system. This explanation aims to offer insight into how these elements collaborate to create a cohesive and efficient backend architecture for the project.

###### Landing

The landing page is a vital component of any major project, serving as the first point of interaction for users and shaping their initial impressions. For a sophisticated AI-driven project like Assisti, the landing page acts as the gateway to its advanced features, offering a clear and engaging introduction. It not only highlights the projectâ€™s purpose and capabilities but also establishes trust and encourages user engagement. A well-designed landing page ensures visitors understand the value of the project and are guided seamlessly to explore further. This crucial section sets the tone for the user experience and reflects the quality and innovation behind Assisti.

In Assisti, the landing page has been meticulously crafted to provide a comprehensive yet intuitive overview of the projectâ€™s offerings. Its design prioritizes clarity, user-friendliness, and visual appeal, making it an effective tool for conveying the projectâ€™s unique AI-driven solutions. From compelling headlines to strategically placed call-to-actions, every element has been optimized to capture user attention and drive engagement. This section not only showcases Assistiâ€™s core features but also emphasizes its practical applications, ensuring visitors see its relevance to their needs. The following description delves deeper into the design and functionality of this pivotal aspect of Assisti.

The landing page of Project Assisti is designed with a user-friendly interface, featuring a top navigation bar that provides quick access to essential functionalities. It includes a login button, primarily used for authentication, and a signup option for creating new user accounts, enabling seamless authentication and authorization processes within the platform. The page layout is optimized for large screens, ensuring a visually appealing and intuitive user experience. Below is a preview of how the landing page appears on larger devices:

![Landing Page](../Assets/Architecture/Landing/Images/Landing%20Page.png)

To demonstrate my expertise in responsive design and developmentâ€”a critical skill for a senior full-stack developerâ€”I present my work on the super AI project, Assisti, optimized for both large screens (desktops and PCs) and small screens (mobile platforms). This showcases my ability to create user interfaces that seamlessly adapt across devices, ensuring an exceptional user experience.

Itâ€™s important to note that while a Customer Experience (CX) specialist might excel at planning a project's overall strategy, they may lack the ability to design client-centric user interfaces. Similarly, a UI designer might craft visually appealing and intuitive designs but may not fully understand the software development process, potentially leading to conflicts between design and development teams. As a senior full-stack developer, I bridge this gap by combining my skills in design, development, and strategic planning to create cohesive, user-focused products that meet and exceed client expectations.

Below, I highlight the landing page of Assisti, demonstrating its functionality with both the top navigation bar closed and opened, reflecting my commitment to detail and responsiveness in design.

##### OCR

###### Overview

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a technology that converts images of textâ€”such as scanned documents, photos of signs, or handwritten notesâ€”into machine-readable text data. This process enables computers to interpret and manipulate text that was previously locked within physical or digital images, facilitating tasks like editing, searching, and indexing. By transforming visual text into digital formats, OCR serves as a bridge between analog information and digital processing systems.

The primary purpose of OCR is to digitize printed or handwritten text, making it accessible for electronic editing, storage, and analysis. This digitization is crucial for automating data entry processes, reducing the need for manual transcription, and minimizing errors associated with human input. In various industries, OCR streamlines workflows by enabling quick extraction of information from physical documents, thereby enhancing efficiency and productivity.

In the realm of artificial intelligence (AI), OCR plays a significant role by providing the means to process and analyze textual information from diverse sources. AI-powered OCR systems leverage machine learning algorithms to improve accuracy in text recognition, especially in complex scenarios involving varied fonts, languages, and layouts. This integration allows for more sophisticated data analysis and extraction, supporting applications such as automated document classification and information retrieval.

Modern AI-driven OCR systems utilize deep learning techniques to enhance their capabilities. By training neural networks on vast datasets of text images, these systems learn to recognize patterns and features associated with different characters and handwriting styles. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of text extraction, even in challenging conditions like low-quality images or unconventional fonts.

One of the key advancements in AI-based OCR is the ability to handle multilingual text recognition. Traditional OCR systems often struggled with non-Latin scripts or documents containing multiple languages. AI models, however, can be trained on diverse linguistic datasets, enabling them to accurately process text in various languages and scripts, thus broadening the applicability of OCR technology globally.

The applications of AI-enhanced OCR are vast and span multiple industries. In the financial sector, for instance, OCR is used to digitize checks and invoices, facilitating automated processing and reducing manual workload. In healthcare, patient records and prescriptions can be digitized for better data management and accessibility. Moreover, in the legal field, OCR assists in managing large volumes of documents by making them searchable and easier to organize.

AI-powered OCR systems also contribute to accessibility improvements. By converting printed materials into digital formats, these systems enable screen readers to vocalize text for visually impaired individuals. This functionality promotes inclusivity and ensures that information is available to a broader audience, aligning with universal design principles.

The integration of OCR with AI has led to the development of intelligent document processing solutions. These systems not only extract text but also understand the context and structure of documents, allowing for tasks like data validation, extraction of specific information fields, and integration with other business processes. Such capabilities are essential for automating complex workflows and enhancing decision-making processes.

Despite significant advancements, challenges remain in OCR technology, particularly concerning handwritten text recognition. Variations in individual handwriting styles, coupled with issues like poor image quality, can affect accuracy. However, ongoing research in AI and machine learning continues to address these challenges, with newer models showing improved performance in recognizing and interpreting handwritten content.

Looking ahead, the future of OCR is closely tied to developments in AI. As machine learning models become more sophisticated, we can expect OCR systems to achieve higher accuracy rates and handle increasingly complex documents. The continuous evolution of AI will likely expand the capabilities of OCR, making it an even more integral tool in data processing and information management across various sectors.

###### `easyocr` Backbone

EasyOCR consists of three components, The three main components of EasyOCR, are feature extraction, sequence labeling, and decoding. In order to extract useful features from the input image, deep learning models such as ResNet and VGG are used in feature extraction. These characteristics are essential for text recognition in pictures. Sequence labeling, the next step, uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to interpret the extracted featuresâ€™ sequential context. Text pattern recognition and structuring are crucial tasks for LSTM networks. Finally, the decoding part decodes and transcribes the labeled sequences into the actual recognized text using the  =Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) algorithm= . These three elements function as a unit to allow EasyOCR to reliably and effectively extract text from images.The training pipeline is based on the deep-text-recognition-benchmark framework, which enhances text recognition in images and offers a strong basis for OCR execution.

**1. Feature Extraction (Resnet and VGG):**

The recognition modelâ€™s first step is feature extraction. In order to create a set of features that can be utilized for additional analysis, the input data must be converted. With EasyOCR, VGG and Resnet are used for this.

Resnet, also known as Residual Networks, is a kind of convolutional neural network (CNN) that bypasses certain layers by using shortcuts or skip connections. This makes it possible for the network to be deeper and still be trainable by resolving the issue of vanishing gradients. Learning the residual representation functions rather than the signal representation directly is the fundamental tenet of the Resnet architecture. This lowers the modelâ€™s complexity and facilitates the networkâ€™s learning process.

An additional kind of CNN is called Visual Geometry Group, or VGG. Its uniform architecture and simplicity are well-known. Its homogeneous architecture consists of very small (3x3) convolution filters stacked deeper and deeper on top of one another. This simplifies the networkâ€™s understanding and modification by lowering the number of computation and parameters.

**2. Sequence Labeling (LSTM):**

Sequence labeling comes next after feature extraction. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are used for this.

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) of the long-sequence learning and memory type, or LSTMs, are able to model the temporal dependencies of multiple time steps. The distinct design of LSTM, in contrast to conventional RNNs, aids in preventing the vanishing gradient issue. The memory cell and the three different kinds of gates â€” input, forget, and output â€” allow it to accomplish this. These elements give LSTM great efficacy for sequence labeling tasks by enabling it to add or remove information from the cell state over extended sequences.

**3. Decoding (CTC):**

Decodering is the last step in the recognition model, and Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) is used to do this.

A kind of loss function called CTC is applied to sequence issues in which time is uncertain. It is applied in situations where we are unsure of the alignment between the labels and the input data, which frequently occurs in speech and handwriting recognition. In order to provide a prediction with a variable length, CTC appends a blank label in addition to existing labels. It is then perfect for OCR decoding tasks because it computes loss by adding up all possible alignments of the input to the target sequences.

An altered version of the deep-text-recognition-benchmark architecture serves as the training pipeline for EasyOCRâ€™s recognition execution. With the use of this framework, text recognition models can be trained on a variety of datasets, making EasyOCR incredibly versatile and effective.

###### Assisti `ocr/utils.py`

The provided code defines a utility class, `EasyOCRReader`, which acts as a wrapper for managing an instance of the EasyOCR model. This design ensures that the OCR model is instantiated only once (singleton pattern), optimizing resource usage and avoiding redundant model loading.

ðŸ“Œ **1. Importing the Required Library**

```python
import easyocr
```

This line imports the `easyocr` library, which is an open-source OCR tool capable of recognizing text in various languages. This library is the backbone of the OCR functionality in the project.

* **Purpose**: Load and utilize the OCR model for text recognition tasks.
* **Significance**: EasyOCR supports over 80 languages and is highly efficient for text extraction from images.

ðŸ“Œ **2. Defining the `EasyOCRReader` Class**

```python
class EasyOCRReader:
    _instance = None
```

Here, the class `EasyOCRReader` is declared with a class-level attribute `_instance`. This attribute is used to store the single instance of the class.

* **Singleton Pattern**: The singleton design pattern ensures that only one instance of the class is created throughout the application's lifecycle.
* **Why Singleton**: Loading the OCR model is computationally expensive, and redundant loading can waste resources. By using a singleton, the model is initialized only once.

ðŸ“Œ **3. Implementing the `get_instance` Method**

```python
@staticmethod
def get_instance():
    if EasyOCRReader._instance is None:
        EasyOCRReader()
    return EasyOCRReader._instance
```

This static method provides a way to access the singleton instance of the `EasyOCRReader` class.

* **Steps**:
  1. Check if `_instance` is `None`.
  2. If it is `None`, create a new instance of `EasyOCRReader`.
  3. Return the `_instance` of the class.
* **Why Static Method**: Since the method does not rely on an instance of the class (itâ€™s responsible for creating one), it's declared as `@staticmethod`.

ðŸ“Œ **4. Initializing the `EasyOCRReader` Class**

```python
def __init__(self):
    if EasyOCRReader._instance is not None:
        raise Exception("This class is a singleton!")
    else:
        print("Initializing EasyOCR model...")
        EasyOCRReader._instance = easyocr.Reader(['ch_sim', 'en'])  # Load the OCR model
        print("EasyOCR model loaded.")
```

This is the constructor method responsible for initializing the OCR model.

* **Key Points**:
  * Checks if `_instance` is already initialized. If it is, raises an exception to prevent multiple instantiations.
  * If `_instance` is `None`, it initializes the EasyOCR model using `easyocr.Reader` with support for simplified Chinese (`ch_sim`) and English (`en`).
  * Prints messages to indicate the initialization and successful loading of the model.
* **Languages**:
  * `ch_sim`: Simplified Chinese
  * `en`: English
* **Why Print Statements**: These statements provide feedback during runtime, indicating the status of the model initialization.

ðŸ“Œ **Code in One Glance**

Below is the code provided, annotated and formatted for readability:

```python
# utils.py

# Import the EasyOCR library
import easyocr

# Define a class to manage the EasyOCR model as a singleton
class EasyOCRReader:
    # Class-level attribute to store the singleton instance
    _instance = None

    # Static method to get the singleton instance of EasyOCRReader
    @staticmethod
    def get_instance():
        # If no instance exists, create one
        if EasyOCRReader._instance is None:
            EasyOCRReader()
        # Return the existing or newly created instance
        return EasyOCRReader._instance

    # Constructor method
    def __init__(self):
        # If an instance already exists, raise an exception
        if EasyOCRReader._instance is not None:
            raise Exception("This class is a singleton!")
        else:
            # Initialize the EasyOCR model and store it in _instance
            print("Initializing EasyOCR model...")
            EasyOCRReader._instance = easyocr.Reader(['ch_sim', 'en'])  # Load the OCR model
            print("EasyOCR model loaded.")
```

ðŸ“Œ *How It Works in the Project*

* **Purpose**: The `EasyOCRReader` class encapsulates the OCR model initialization and provides a globally accessible instance to avoid redundant loads.
* **Usage**:
  * To access the OCR model:

    ```python
    ocr_reader = EasyOCRReader.get_instance()
    ```
  * This ensures that the model is loaded only once and reused across the application.
* **Advantages**:
  * **Performance Optimization**: Reduces resource overhead by avoiding multiple initializations of the OCR model.
  * **Ease of Use**: Provides a centralized way to manage the OCR model, simplifying integration into other project modules.
  * **Scalability**: Can be extended to support more languages or additional configurations if needed.

###### Assisti `ocr/models.py`

Hereâ€™s the explanation of `ocr/models.py` based on the note that the `DigitPic` model represents OCR detection within the Assisti project, not just digit recognition:

ðŸ“Œ **1. Importing Required Modules**

The first section imports necessary modules from Django and Python libraries:

* `models` from `django.db`: Provides classes for defining database models.
* `settings` from `django.conf`: Imports project-wide settings, including `AUTH_USER_MODEL`.
* `uuid`: A Python module to generate universally unique identifiers (UUIDs).

These imports are essential for defining and configuring the `DigitPic` model, enabling secure user associations, automatic creation of IDs, and handling of images.

```python
from django.db import models
from django.conf import settings
import uuid
```

ðŸ“Œ **2. Defining the `DigitPic` Model**

This model represents an entity for OCR detection, linking image files and metadata with specific users in the Assisti project. The `DigitPic` class inherits from `models.Model`, which is the base class for all Django models.

ðŸ“Œ **3. Model Fields**

The fields of the `DigitPic` model define the attributes and relationships stored in the database:

* **`owner`**: A foreign key linking each instance to a user from the `AUTH_USER_MODEL`.
  * `on_delete=models.CASCADE`: Ensures that when a user is deleted, their related `DigitPic` entries are also removed.
  * `null=True` and `blank=True`: Make the field optional.
* **`title`**: A `CharField` for storing the name or title of the OCR entry.
  * `max_length=100`: Limits the character length to 100.
  * `null=True` and `blank=True`: Make the field optional.
* **`whatDigit`**: A `CharField` to store additional predictions or metadata related to the detected text or image content. It is also optional.
* **`digitImage`**: An `ImageField` to store uploaded images for OCR processing.
  * `blank=True` and `null=True`: Make the field optional.
  * `default`: Specifies a default placeholder image.
  * `upload_to`: Defines the directory structure for storing uploaded images.
* **`created`**: A `DateTimeField` with `auto_now_add=True` to automatically record when an OCR detection instance is created.
* **`id`**: A primary key field that uses `UUID` for unique, unguessable identifiers.
  * `primary_key=True`: Designates this field as the primary key.
  * `editable=False` and `unique=True`: Ensure the ID is immutable and unique.

```python
class DigitPic(models.Model):
    owner = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL,
                              on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True, blank=True)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100, null=True, blank=True)
    whatDigit = models.CharField(max_length=1000, blank=True, null=True)
    digitImage = models.ImageField(
        blank=True, null=True, default="aiEngineering/digitDetector/Default.png", upload_to="aiEngineering/digitDetector/")
    created = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    id = models.UUIDField(default=uuid.uuid4,
                          primary_key=True, editable=False, unique=True)
```

ðŸ“Œ **4. String Representation**

The `__str__` method defines how the model instance is represented as a string. In this case, the file name of the uploaded `digitImage` is returned, making debugging and logs more readable.

```python
    def __str__(self):
        return self.digitImage.name
```

ðŸ“Œ **5. Meta Class**

The `Meta` inner class customizes the model's behavior:

* **`verbose_name`**: Defines a user-friendly name for the model in singular form.
* **`verbose_name_plural`**: Specifies the plural form for the model name in admin interfaces.

```python
    class Meta:
        verbose_name = "OCR Detector"
        verbose_name_plural = "OCR Detectors"
```

ðŸ“Œ **Complete Code**

Hereâ€™s the complete code block with all sections explained:

```python
from django.db import models
from django.conf import settings
import uuid


class DigitPic(models.Model):
    owner = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL,
                              on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True, blank=True)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100, null=True, blank=True)
    whatDigit = models.CharField(max_length=1000, blank=True, null=True)
    digitImage = models.ImageField(
        blank=True, null=True, default="aiEngineering/digitDetector/Default.png", upload_to="aiEngineering/digitDetector/")
    created = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    id = models.UUIDField(default=uuid.uuid4,
                          primary_key=True, editable=False, unique=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.digitImage.name

    class Meta:
        verbose_name = "OCR Detector"
        verbose_name_plural = "OCR Detectors"
```

ðŸ“Œ **Use Case**
In the Assisti project, this model is used for managing OCR detection records. It:

1. Links OCR detection entries to specific users.
2. Stores images uploaded for OCR processing.
3. Tracks metadata related to OCR detections (such as predicted text, creation timestamp, and titles).

By utilizing Djangoâ€™s Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) capabilities, this code simplifies database management and ensures the efficient storage and retrieval of OCR-related data for Assisti.

###### Assisti `ocr/signals.py`

This code snippet demonstrates an automated OCR-based digit detection system using Django's `post_save` signal. The implementation seamlessly integrates with the `DigitPic` model, allowing for real-time image detection and classification. The primary objective of this setup is to ensure that uploaded or updated images are immediately processed, and their detected content is stored in the database for efficient handling and retrieval.

ðŸ“Œ **1. Importing Required Libraries and Modules**

The first section imports the necessary modules and signals:

```python
# Libraries
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.db.models.signals import post_save

# Modules
from AiEngineering.digitDetector.models import DigitPic
```

* **`receiver` and `post_save`**: These are Django utilities for signal handling. The `receiver` decorator connects a function to a signal, while `post_save` triggers actions after a model instance is saved.
* **`DigitPic`**: This is the model representing the uploaded images and their detected values.

ðŸ“Œ **2. Signal to Detect and Process Images**

The core functionality resides in the `detect_digit_pic` function, which acts as a listener for `post_save` events on the `DigitPic` model.

```python
@receiver(post_save, sender=DigitPic)
def detect_digit_pic(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    """ Re-detecting the digit image on save method call. """
```

- **Purpose**: Listens for any save operation on the `DigitPic` model. Whether a new instance is created or an existing one is updated, this function ensures the image is processed promptly.

ðŸ“Œ **3. Loading the EasyOCR Reader**

```python
    from .utils import EasyOCRReader
    reader = EasyOCRReader.get_instance()
```

- **`EasyOCRReader`**: A utility class providing a singleton instance of the EasyOCR model, ensuring efficient resource usage.
- **`get_instance()`**: Retrieves the OCR reader instance, initializing it only once per application lifecycle.

ðŸ“Œ **4. Extracting Image Path and Running OCR**

```python
    image_path = instance.digitImage.path
    detected_digit = reader.readtext(image_path, detail=0)[0]
```

- **`image_path`**: Fetches the full path to the saved image file.
- **`readtext()`**: Processes the image to detect and extract the content. The `detail=0` parameter ensures only the detected text is returned, without additional metadata.
- **`[0]`**: Accesses the first result, as only one digit is expected in the image.

ðŸ“Œ **5. Updating the Model if Needed**

```python
    if instance.digitImage and (instance.whatDigit != detected_digit):
        instance.whatDigit = detected_digit
        print(f"\nDetected Digit: {detected_digit}\n")
        instance.save()
```

- **Condition Check**: Ensures that the `whatDigit` field is updated only if the detected digit is different from the existing value. This avoids unnecessary database writes.
- **Logging**: Prints the detected digit for debugging or monitoring purposes.
- **Save Operation**: Updates the model instance with the new digit value.

ðŸ“Œ **Key Features of the Code**

1. **Automated Image Processing**: Every save operation on the `DigitPic` model triggers an OCR detection process, ensuring immediate updates.
2. **Efficient Singleton Design**: The EasyOCR reader instance is reused across the application, optimizing memory and processing time.
3. **Error-Free Updates**: By checking the existing `whatDigit` value before updating, the system minimizes redundant operations.
4. **Real-time Monitoring**: The detected digit is logged in the console, allowing developers to verify the system's functionality during runtime.

ðŸ“Œ **Code Implementation**

```python
# Libraries
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.db.models.signals import post_save

# Modules
from AiEngineering.digitDetector.models import DigitPic


# Detect the image on save method call
@receiver(post_save, sender=DigitPic)
def detect_digit_pic(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    """ Re-detecting the digit image on save method call. """

    # Import the Easy OCR Reader
    from .utils import EasyOCRReader

    # Get the OCR reader instance
    reader = EasyOCRReader.get_instance()

    # Get the image path
    image_path = instance.digitImage.path

    # Detect the saved image digit with classifier
    detected_digit = reader.readtext(image_path, detail=0)[0]

    # Check two conditions: 1. digitImage isn't Empty, 2. this object's whatDigit is not equal to detected_digit
    if instance.digitImage and (instance.whatDigit != detected_digit):
        # Save the detected digit to this object
        instance.whatDigit = detected_digit

        # Show the saved detected digit in Command
        print(f"\nDetected Digit: {detected_digit}\n")

        # Finally, save this digit image object model
        instance.save()
```

This approach demonstrates a professional, efficient backend workflow for handling OCR-based image detection and classification. The implementation can be expanded to include additional preprocessing steps, multi-language support, or error handling, making it suitable for various AI-driven applications.

###### Assisti `ocr/forms.py`

To create an OCR object model, a form is required to facilitate the creation of the OCR object and predict its label. The following section will explain the OCR model forms used for this purpose. Below is a comprehensive explanation of this section:

ðŸ“Œ **1. Importing Necessary Modules**

```python
from django import forms
from .models import DigitPic
```

* `from django import forms`: This imports the `forms` module from Django, which provides tools for creating and handling web forms.
* `from .models import DigitPic`: This imports the `DigitPic` model from the same app (`.` refers to the current directory), which is used to define the structure of the model and interact with the database.

ðŸ“Œ **2. Defining the `DigitPicForm` Class**

```python
class DigitPicForm(forms.ModelForm):
```

* `DigitPicForm` is a subclass of `forms.ModelForm`, which is a special form class in Django that automatically generates a form based on a model. This form will be used to interact with the `DigitPic` model.

ðŸ“Œ **3. Meta Class for Model and Fields**

```python
class Meta:
    model = DigitPic
    fields = ['title', 'digitImage']  # Only include the title and digitImage fields
```

* The `Meta` class is used to provide additional configuration for the form. Here, it specifies:
  * `model = DigitPic`: The form is associated with the `DigitPic` model.
  * `fields = ['title', 'digitImage']`: Only the `title` and `digitImage` fields will be included in the form, meaning the form will not handle other model fields such as `whatDigit` or `created`.

ðŸ“Œ **4. Customizing the Form Fields**

```python
def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
    super(DigitPicForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
```

* This is the form's `__init__` method, which is called when an instance of the form is created. The `super(DigitPicForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)` call ensures that the parent class (`forms.ModelForm`) initialization is run first, allowing the form to function correctly.

ðŸ“Œ **5. Customizing the `title` Field**

```python
self.fields['title'].widget.attrs.update({
    'class': 'form-control',
    'placeholder': 'Your image title ...',  # You can change this placeholder
})
```

* `self.fields['title']`: This refers to the `title` field from the model.
* `widget.attrs.update(...)`: This allows customization of the field's HTML attributes. Specifically:
  * `'class': 'form-control'`: This adds the `form-control` class to the `title` input field, which applies Bootstrap's styling to the form input.
  * `'placeholder': 'Your image title ...'`: This sets a placeholder text inside the input field, providing a hint to the user about what to enter in the field.

ðŸ“Œ **6. Customizing the `digitImage` Field**

```python
self.fields['digitImage'].widget.attrs.update({
    'class': 'form-control',
    'placeholder': 'Choose an image',  # Placeholder for image input is not standard but can be used for styling
})
```

* `self.fields['digitImage']`: This refers to the `digitImage` field from the model.
* `widget.attrs.update(...)`: Similar to the `title` field, this customizes the `digitImage` field:
  * `'class': 'form-control'`: Adds the `form-control` class for Bootstrap styling.
  * `'placeholder': 'Choose an image'`: While placeholders are not typically used for file input fields, this provides a placeholder for visual consistency or can be styled accordingly.

ðŸ“Œ **Final Insights**

This form is designed to handle two main pieces of information:

1. **Title**: A textual field for the user to provide a name or title for the image.
2. **Digit Image**: A file upload field where the user selects an image (typically a digit image for recognition purposes).

The custom styling using Bootstrap's `form-control` ensures that both fields are visually consistent with a modern web application. The placeholders give further guidance to users for interacting with the form fields.

This form (`DigitPicForm`) is designed for creating and updating `DigitPic` model instances in Django. It allows users to provide a title and upload an image. By using `ModelForm`, it automatically handles form validation and persistence to the database. The form also includes custom styling via Bootstrap classes, making it easy to integrate into a web application with a modern look and feel. The placeholders guide users and improve the user experience when interacting with the form.

###### Understanding Assisti's Routing (`urls.py`) and Logic (`views.py`) in the OCR Module

ðŸ“Œ **Overview**

This section demonstrates the navigation process to access the OCR feature in Assisti. The user flow and actions required to reach the OCR section are outlined below for clarity.

To access the OCR feature in Assisti, users first log in to their account. From the landing page, they can scroll down to the carousel highlighting Assisti's various applications. By simply clicking or tapping the 'See More' button within the carousel, they will seamlessly navigate to the OCR section.

{% endraw %}
```

After clicking the 'See More' button, the URL associated with the `digit-detector-welcome` pattern is requested via HTTP using the `url` tag.

The mentioned URL is connected to the following URL pattern:

```python
...
  
    ## -- >> Digit Detector Introduction
    path("", views.digit_detector_welcome, name="digit-detector-welcome"),

...
```

As shown above, this URL pattern is associated with the `views.digit_detector_welcome` view, which will be explained in the following section.

ðŸ“Œ `@login_required(login_url="login-view")`

This line is a decorator that ensures the user must be authenticated (logged in) to access the view. If the user is not logged in, they will be redirected to the specified login page, which in this case is mapped by the URL name `"login-view"`.

ðŸ“Œ `def digit_detector_welcome(request):`

This line defines the function `digit_detector_welcome`, which is the view function that will be called when the corresponding URL pattern is matched. The function takes the `request` object as an argument, which contains information about the HTTP request made by the client.

ðŸ“Œ `digits = DigitPic.objects.filter(owner=request.user,)`

This line queries the `DigitPic` model to retrieve all the `DigitPic` objects associated with the currently logged-in user. The `filter()` method is used to retrieve records where the `owner` field matches `request.user`, which refers to the authenticated user making the request. This ensures that only the digit pictures that belong to the current user are retrieved.

ðŸ“Œ `context = { "digits": digits, }`

This line creates a context dictionary to pass data to the template. The `digits` variable, which contains the queryset of digit pictures, is included in the context. The context is then passed to the template to be rendered dynamically.

ðŸ“Œ `return render(request, "digitDetector/digits-intro.html", context)`

This line returns an HTTP response generated by rendering the `"digitDetector/digits-intro.html"` template. The `render()` function combines the `request` object, the path to the template, and the context data (`digits`) to generate the final HTML page that will be sent back to the client.

ðŸ“Œ Summary

- This view is accessible only to authenticated users (via `@login_required`).
- It retrieves the digit images (`DigitPic` objects) that belong to the current logged-in user.
- It passes these images to the `digits-intro.html` template, which will use this data to display the relevant information to the user.

The final view code at a glance is as follows:

```Python
...

@login_required(login_url="login-view")
def digit_detector_welcome(request):
  
    digits = DigitPic.objects.filter(
        owner = request.user,
    )
  
    context = {
        "digits": digits,
    }
  
    return render(request, "digitDetector/digits-intro.html", context)

...
```

Another way to access the Assisti OCR zone section is by using the services offered by Assisti. After logging in, users can click on the Services option in the top navigation bar on large screens or expand the top navigation bar on smaller screens, such as mobile devices, and tap on the Services option. This section is illustrated in the images below.

- Services option in the top navigation bar after logging in (Desktop and PC view)

![Web Landing Page | Web | Large Screen | Desktop and PCs](../Assets/Artificial%20Intelligence/OCR/Landing%20Page%20After%20Login%20-%20Web%20-%20PCs%20and%20Desktop.png)

- Top navigation bar in its closed state on small screens (Mobile view)

![Landing Page | Mobile Web View | Navbar Closed](../Assets/Architecture/Landing/Images/Landing%20Page%20-%20Mobile%20Web%20View%20-%20Navbar%20Closed.png)

- Top navigation bar in its opened state on small screens (Mobile view)

![Landing Page | Mobile Web View | Navbar Opened](../Assets/Architecture/Landing/Images/Landing%20Page%20-%20Mobile%20Web%20View%20-%20Navbar%20Opened.png)

- Services webpage (Desktop view)

![Services | Desktop and PC | Web | OCR](../Assets/Artificial%20Intelligence/OCR/Services%20-%20OCR%20-%20Desktops%20and%20PCs.png)

- Services webpage (Mobile view)

![Services | Mobile | Web | OCR](../Assets/Artificial%20Intelligence/OCR/Services%20-%20OCR%20-%20Mobile.png)

To explain the backend process of accessing services through the Services option, the Services menu item is linked to the following template:

```html
{% raw %}

...

<li class="nav-item d-xxl-flex justify-content-xxl-center align-items-xxl-center mt-2 mb-2">
  
  <a class="nav-link me-5 MuhammadHusainAbootalebi-Navbar-NavItem-Link" id="MuhammadHusainAbootalebi-NavItem-Services-link" href="{% url 'all-services' %}" style="color: #000814;font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">
  
    <i class="bi bi-x-diamond-fill MuhammadHusainAbootalebi-Navbar-NavItem-Link-Icon active"></i>
  
    Services
  
  </a>
</li>

...

{% endraw %}
```

As seen above, the Services option is linked to the `all-services` URL pattern, which is defined as follows:

```python
...
  
    # All Services
    path("services/", services, name="all-services"),

...
```

The above URL pattern is linked to the `services` view, which is defined as follows:

```Python
...

def services(request):
    return render(request, "Services.html")

...
```

As seen above, the `services` view simply uses the `render` method with the passed request to render the `Services.html` template. In the `Services.html` template, the process of clicking on the 'See More' button is similar to the previous process of navigating to the `digit_detector_welcome` view, which was explained earlier.

In each scenario, the user will navigate to a page that looks like the one below. The process of creating, editing, reading, and deleting OCR models is explained next.

- Optical Charactrer Recognition (Large Screens Web View)

![OCR Zone | Web | Mobile](../Assets/Artificial%20Intelligence/OCR/OCR%20-%20Introduction%20--%20Mobile.png)

ðŸ“Œ **Creating OCR Models**

To interact with the Assisti OCR detector in real time, users can access the OCR introduction page, as shown below. On desktop web views, the 'OCR Detection' button can be clicked, while on mobile web views, it can be tapped to initiate the detection process.

- Optical Character Recognition (Large Screens Web View)

![OCR Zone | Web | Desktop](../Assets/Artificial%20Intelligence/OCR/OCR%20-%20Introduction%20--%20Desktop.png)

- Optical Character Recognition (Small Screens Web View)

![OCR Zone | Web | Mobile](../Assets/Artificial%20Intelligence/OCR/OCR%20-%20Introduction%20--%20Mobile.png)

To illustrate the background process leading to the OCR detection page, the following front-end code is triggered when the 'OCR Detection' button is clicked or tapped.

```html
{% raw %}

...

<a
  class="btn btn-primary btn-lg d-xxl-flex justify-content-xxl-center align-items-xxl-center me-2 ps-5 pe-5 w-100"
  role="button" href="{% url 'digit-create' %}"
  style="background: rgb(0,0,0); color: rgb(255,214,10);font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;font-weight: bold;border-style: none;">

    <svg 
      xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" 
      width="1em" 
      height="1em"
      fill="currentColor" 
      viewBox="0 0 16 16" 
      class="bi bi-caret-right-fill">
        <path 
          d="m12.14 8.753-5.482 4.796c-.646.566-1.658.106-1.658-.753V3.204a1 1 0 0 1 1.659-.753l5.48 4.796a1 1 0 0 1 0 1.506z">
        </path>
    </svg>
</a>

...

{% endraw %}
```

In the code above, the anchor link references the `digit-create` URL pattern name, which is mapped to the following URL pattern:

```python
...

  path("digit-create/", views.digit_create, name="digit-create"),

...
```

As seen in the code above, the `digit-create` URL name is mapped to `views.digit_create` via an HTTP request, facilitating the rendering of the OCR detection form web page, which appears as follows:

- Optical Character Recognition Creation Form (Large Screens Web View)

![OCR Creation Form | Web | Desktop](../Assets/Artificial%20Intelligence/OCR/OCR%20Detection%20Form%20Creation%20-%20Desktop%20Web%20View.png)

- Optical Character Recognition Creation Form (Small Screens Web View)

![OCR Creation Form | Web | Mobile](../Assets/Artificial%20Intelligence/OCR/OCR%20Detection%20Form%20Creation%20-%20Mobile%20Web%20View.png)

As seen above, the front-end implementation of the OCR creation form is developed professionally, highlighting my expertise in front-end programming. To keep the documentation concise, the backend implementation of the OCR model creation view will be explained below.

```python
@login_required(login_url="login-view")
```

- This decorator ensures that only authenticated users can access this view.
- If an unauthenticated user tries to access this view, they will be redirected to the login page (`login-view`).

```python
def digit_create(request):
```

- This function defines the `digit_create` view, which handles the creation of new OCR digit recognition objects.

```python
    forms = DigitPicForm()
```

- An empty instance of the `DigitPicForm` is created to be displayed in the template for user input.

```python
    if request.method == "POST":
```

- Checks if the request method is **POST**, indicating that the form has been submitted.

```python
        forms = DigitPicForm(request.POST, request.FILES)
```

- If the request is **POST**, the form is re-initialized with the submitted data (`request.POST`) and uploaded files (`request.FILES`).

```python
        if forms.is_valid():
```

- Validates the form to ensure all required fields are properly filled and the uploaded file meets the expected format.

```python
            digit = forms.save(commit=False)
```

- The form is temporarily saved without committing to the database.
- This allows setting additional attributes (like assigning an owner) before finalizing the save.

```python
            digit.owner = request.user
```

- The authenticated user who submitted the form is assigned as the `owner` of the digit object.

```python
            digit.save()
```

- The `digit` object is now fully saved in the database. The OCR signal will be triggered to detect the characters in the uploaded image, as explained earlier.

```python
            messages.success(request, "Digit was successfully predicted.")
```

- A success message is displayed to inform the user that the digit has been successfully processed.

```python
            return redirect("digit-read-detail", digit.id)
```

- After saving, the user is redirected to the **digit detail page** (`digit-read-detail`), where they can see the predicted results.

```python
    context = {
        "forms": forms,
    }
```

- A context dictionary is created containing the form instance, which will be passed to the template.

```python
    return render(request, "digitDetector/digit-create.html", context)
```

- The `digit-create.html` template is rendered, displaying the form for the user.

Summary of Functionality:

- Ensures that only authenticated users can create OCR digit recognition objects.
- Displays a form for uploading an image and providing a title.
- Handles form submission and validation.
- Associates the uploaded digit image with the logged-in user.
- Saves the digit object and redirects to its detail page upon successful submission.
- Displays a success message to the user.
- Renders the **digit creation form** for GET requests.

This structured approach ensures a smooth and user-friendly process for creating OCR objects while maintaining security and proper validation. ðŸš€

The complete code for this view can be seen at a glance below:

```Python
...

@login_required(login_url="login-view")
def digit_create(request):
  
    forms = DigitPicForm()
  
    if request.method == "POST":
        forms = DigitPicForm(request.POST, request.FILES)
        if forms.is_valid():
            digit = forms.save(commit=False)
            digit.owner = request.user
            digit.save()
            messages.success(request, "Digit was successfully predicted.")
            return redirect("digit-read-detail", digit.id)
  
    context = {
        "forms": forms,
    }
  
    return render(request, "digitDetector/digit-create.html", context)

...
```

ðŸ“Œ **Editing OCR Models**

Another aspect of the OCR zone is editing the OCR object models in a way that allows changing either the object title or the image. To see the predicted images in the OCR zone, scroll to the bottom of the page where the predicted images can be seen.

- OCR Landing Page (Samll Screens Web View)

![OCR Zone First View | Web | Mobile](../Assets/Artificial%20Intelligence/OCR/OCR%20-%20Introduction%20--%20Mobile.png)

After that, by scrolling to the bottom of the OCR zone web page, the predicted models can be seen. The images below show what the predicted object models look like.

- OCR Predicted Objects (Large Screens Web View)

![OCR Zone Second View | Web | Desktop](../Assets/Artificial%20Intelligence/OCR/OCR%20Prediction%20Models%20Showcases%20-%20Desktop%20Web%20View.png)

![OCR Zone Second View | Web | Mobile](../Assets/Artificial%20Intelligence/OCR/OCR%20Prediction%20Models%20Showcases%20-%20Mobile%20Web%20View.png)

After the 'Edit' button is pressed, the `digit-update` URL name will be requested via HTTP.

```html
{% raw %}

...

<a 
  href="{% url 'digit-update' digit.id %}"
  class="btn btn-primary d-xxl-flex justify-content-xxl-center align-items-xxl-center ps-3 pe-3 me-3"
  type="button"
  style="border-style: none;background: rgb(0,0,0);color: rgb(255,214,10);">

        </path>
    </svg>
    Â  Â 
    Edit
</a>

...

{% endraw %}
```

As seen above, the object model's unique identifier (ID) is passed to the `digit-update` URL pattern name to specify which model should be updated. The `digit-update` URL pattern is shown below:

```python
path("digit-update/<str:pk>/", views.digit_update, name="digit-update"),
```

As seen above, the `digit-update` URL pattern name is linked to the `views.digit_update` view, which is explained below.

```python
@login_required(login_url="login-view")
```

- This decorator ensures that only authenticated users can access this view.
- If a user is not logged in, they will be redirected to the `login-view` page.

```python
def digit_update(request, pk):
```

- Defines the `digit_update` function, which is responsible for handling the update process for a specific `DigitPic` object.
- Accepts `request` (the HTTP request object) and `pk` (the primary key of the `DigitPic` object that needs to be updated).

```python
digit = DigitPic.objects.get(id=pk)
```

- Retrieves the `DigitPic` object from the database based on its unique ID (`pk`).

```python
forms = DigitPicForm(instance=digit)
```

- Initializes a `DigitPicForm` instance, pre-filling it with the data of the retrieved `DigitPic` object.
- This ensures that the form displays the current values of the object, allowing the user to modify them.

```python
if request.method == "POST":
```

- Checks if the request method is `POST`, which means the user has submitted the form to update the object.

```python
form = DigitPicForm(request.POST, request.FILES, instance=digit)
```

- Creates a new `DigitPicForm` instance populated with the submitted form data (`request.POST`) and any uploaded files (`request.FILES`).
- The `instance=digit` argument ensures that the form updates the existing `DigitPic` object instead of creating a new one.

```python
if form.is_valid():
```

- Checks if the form input is valid based on the model constraints and form validation rules.

```python
form.save()
```

- Saves the updated data to the existing `DigitPic` object in the database.

```python
messages.success(request, "Digit was successfully updated")
```

- Displays a success message to the user indicating that the update was successful.

```python
return redirect("digit-read-detail", digit.id)
```

- Redirects the user to the detail page of the updated `DigitPic` object using its ID.
- This prevents form resubmission if the user refreshes the page.

```python
context = {
    "forms": forms,
}
```

- Prepares the `context` dictionary with the form instance to be passed to the template.

```python
return render(request, "digitDetector/digit-create.html", context)
```

- Renders the `digit-create.html` template, passing the form data in the `context` dictionary.
- This allows the user to see and edit the existing values in the form.

After clicking or tapping the 'Edit' button for a predicted OCR object model, the following web page will be displayed.

- OCR Update View (Large Screen Web View)

![OCR Update View | Desktop Web View](../Assets/Artificial%20Intelligence/OCR/OCR%20-%20Update%20View%20-%20Desktop%20Web%20View.png)

- OCR Update View (Small Screen Web View)

![OCR Update View | Mobile Web View](../Assets/Artificial%20Intelligence/OCR/OCR%20-%20Update%20View%20-%20Mobile%20Web%20View.png)

As seen in the images above, the form includes a field for updating the title of the object model. Below that, an anchor link allows users to view the previously uploaded image, followed by an upload field for selecting a new image. At the bottom of the card, a 'Detect' button is provided to initiate the OCR process for the newly uploaded image, predicting its label or the characters it contains. This process occurs after the model is saved, triggering the post-save signal.

ðŸ“Œ **Reading OCR Models**

In order to view each model prediction in detail, the title of each predicted object model must be clicked or tapped. For example, the anchor link, which is underlined with an orange or yellow line, should be clicked or tapped. The view below is displayed after navigating to the OCR zone of Assisti and scrolling down to the bottom of the page.

- OCR Predicted Objects (Large Screens Web View)

![OCR Zone Second View | Web | Desktop](../Assets/Artificial%20Intelligence/OCR/OCR%20Prediction%20Models%20Showcases%20-%20Desktop%20Web%20View.png)

- OCR Predicted Objects (Small Screens Web View)

![OCR Zone Second View | Web | Mobile](../Assets/Artificial%20Intelligence/OCR/OCR%20Prediction%20Models%20Showcases%20-%20Mobile%20Web%20View.png)

After the anchor link is clicked or tapped, the following link is triggered:

```html
{% raw %}

...

<a 
  class="py-2" 
  href="{% url 'digit-read-detail' digit.id %}" 
  style="color:#FFD60A;">
    <h4
      style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;font-weight: bold; color: #000000">
        {{ digit.title }}</h4>
</a>

...

{% endraw %}
```

According to the above code, each anchor link is associated with the `digit-read-detail` URL name, along with the unique identifier (ID) of the object model. The following code shows the linked URL pattern:

```python
...

path("digit-read/<str:pk>/", views.digit_read, name="digit-read-detail"),

...
```

As seen above, the `digit-read-detail` URL name is linked to the `views.digit_read` view, which will be explained next.

`@login_required(login_url="login-view")`

- This is a Django decorator that ensures only authenticated users can access the digit_read view.
- If a user is not logged in, they are redirected to the "login-view" page.

`def digit_read(request, pk):`

- Defines a **view function** named `digit_read` that takes `request` and `pk` (primary key) as parameters.
- `request` represents the **HTTP request** sent by the user.
- `pk` is the **unique identifier** of the `DigitPic` object to be retrieved.

`digit = DigitPic.objects.get(id=pk)`

- Queries the database for a `DigitPic` object where the `id` matches the provided `pk`.
- If the object exists, it is stored in the `digit` variable.
- If no matching object is found, this raises a `DoesNotExist` exception.

`context = { "digit": digit }`

- Creates a **context dictionary** that holds the retrieved `digit` object.
- This dictionary is passed to the template for rendering.

`return render(request, "digitDetector/digit-detail.html", context)`

- Uses Djangoâ€™s `render` function to return an **HTTP response**.
- Renders the `"digitDetector/digit-detail.html"` template.
- Passes the `context` dictionary to the template, allowing it to use `digit` in the HTML.

The complete code at a glance is shown below:

```python
...

@login_required(login_url="login-view")
def digit_read(request, pk):
  
    digit = DigitPic.objects.get(id=pk)
  
    context = {
        "digit": digit,
    }
  
    return render(request, "digitDetector/digit-detail.html", context)

...
```

The rendered OCR object model, in its reading or retrieving process (which corresponds to the "Read" operation in CRUD), looks like this:

- OCR Object Model Reading (Desktop Web View)

![OCR Object Reading (Desktop Web View)](../Assets/Artificial%20Intelligence/OCR/OCR%20Detail%20Reading%20-%20Desktop%20Web%20View.png)

- OCR Object Model Reading (Mobile Web View)

![OCR Object Reading (Mobile Web View)](../Assets/Artificial%20Intelligence/OCR/OCR%20Detail%20Reading%20-%20Mobile%20Web%20View.png)

As seen, the front-end design maintains a professional appearance, similar to the previous web pages. This showcases my expertise in front-end design, as well as backend planning and programming.

The rendered web page contains the uploaded image, the object model title, the natural date-time since creation, and the label or predicted characters. There are two buttons: one to edit the OCR object model and another to delete it.

ðŸ“Œ **Deleting OCR Models**

To delete a created OCR object model, simply click or tap the 'Delete' button. This will navigate to a delete confirmation page, where the user is asked to confirm whether they want to proceed with deleting the object model. The confirmation page looks as follows:

- Delete Confirmation Page (Desktop Web View)

![Delete Confirmation Page (Desktop Web View)](../Assets/Artificial%20Intelligence/OCR/Delete%20Confirmation%20Page%20(Desktop%20Web%20View).png)

- Delete Confirmation Page (Mobile Web View)

![Delete Confirmation Page (Desktop Web View)](../Assets/Artificial%20Intelligence/OCR/Delete%20Confirmation%20Page%20(Mobile%20Web%20View).png)

As seen above, the front-end design exhibits a professional and visually appealing interface, highlighting my expertise in both front-end design and programming. The confirmation message features a sleek glass effect with a modern, futuristic background. If the 'Back' button is clicked or tapped, the user will be redirected to the previous page. However, if the 'Delete' button is selected, the object model will be removed, and the user will be navigated to the OCR Introduction page displayed earlier. Additionally, an alert message confirming the deletion will be shown, as demonstrated below:

- After Delete Confirmation Page (Desktop Web View)

![After Delete Confirmation Page (Desktop Web View)](../Assets/Artificial%20Intelligence/OCR/After%20Delete%20Confirmation%20Page%20(Desktop%20Web%20View).png)

- After Delete Confirmation Page (Mobile Web View)

![After Delete Confirmation Page (Mobile Web View)](../Assets/Artificial%20Intelligence/OCR/After%20Delete%20Confirmation%20Page%20(Mobile%20Web%20View).png)

In this section, it is evident that this project demonstrates my professional expertise in artificial intelligence engineering, showcasing my ability to develop AI models while also building robust front-end and back-end systems. By seamlessly integrating theoretical models into real-time software applications, I exemplify my skills as a professional full-stack developer and software engineer.

To explain the backend process of deleting an OCR object model, when the 'Delete' button is clicked, the `digit-delete` URL name is requested via HTTP. Additionally, the `digit.id`, which serves as the unique identifier for the OCR object, is passed through the HTTP request.

```html
{% raw %}
...

<a
  href="{% url 'digit-delete' digit.id %}?back=digit-detector-welcome"
  class="btn d-xxl-flex justify-content-xxl-center align-items-xxl-center ps-3 pe-3 btn-danger"

    </path>
  </svg>Â  Â 
  Delete
</a>

...
{% endraw %}
```

The mentioned URL name is linked to the following URL path. As seen below, the `digit-delete` URL name is connected to `views.digit_delete`, which will be explained next.

```python
...

  path("digit-delete/<str:pk>/", views.digit_delete, name="digit-delete"),

...
```

```python
@login_required(login_url="login-view")
```

- This decorator ensures that only authenticated users can access the `digit_delete` view.
- If a user is not logged in, they will be redirected to the **login page** (specified by `"login-view"`).

```python
def digit_delete(request, pk):
```

- Defines the `digit_delete` function, which handles the deletion of an **OCR object model**.
- It accepts:
  - `request`: The HTTP request from the user.
  - `pk`: The **primary key** of the object to be deleted (used to identify the specific OCR object).

```python
digit = DigitPic.objects.get(id = pk)
```

- Retrieves the `DigitPic` object from the database using its **primary key (id)**.
- This object represents the OCR model that the user wants to delete.

```python
if request.GET.get("pk") == None:
```

- Checks if a query parameter `pk` exists in the **GET request**.
- If `pk` is **not provided**, the view assumes the user is navigating **back to a previous page** without specifying an object ID.

```python
back = reverse(request.GET.get("back"))
```

- If there is no `pk` in the GET request, this line dynamically generates a **URL** for the previous page (using the `back` parameter in the request).
- The `reverse()` function constructs the URL based on the **provided view name**.

```python
else:
    back = reverse(request.GET.get("back"), kwargs={'pk': request.GET.get("pk")})
```

- If a `pk` is present in the GET request, the `back` URL will include the **specific object ID** in its parameters.
- This ensures that when the user navigates back, the previous view knows which **OCR object model** was referenced.

```python
if request.method == "POST":
```

- Checks if the request is a **POST request** (which means the user confirmed deletion).

```python
digit.delete()
```

- Deletes the retrieved `DigitPic` object from the database.
- This **removes the OCR object model permanently**.

```python
messages.success(request, "Object was successfully deleted.")
```

- After deletion, a success message is sent to the user indicating that the object was deleted successfully.
- This message will be displayed in the UI using Djangoâ€™s **message framework**.

```python
return redirect("digit-detector-welcome")
```

- After the object is deleted, the user is redirected to the **digit detector welcome page**.
- This ensures a smooth user experience after deletion.

```python
context = {
    "object": digit.title,
    "back": back,
}
```

- Creates a context dictionary that passes data to the **delete confirmation template**:
  - `"object"`: Contains the **title** of the OCR model being deleted (used for confirmation).
  - `"back"`: Holds the **URL** to return to the previous page.

```python
return render(request, "delete-object-model.html", context)
```

- Renders the **delete confirmation page** (`delete-object-model.html`) with the provided context.
- This page asks the user for **final confirmation** before deletion.

ðŸ“Œ **Summary of Functionality:**

- Ensures only **authenticated users** can delete OCR models.
- Fetches the **OCR object** using its primary key (`pk`).
- Checks if a **previous page URL** exists to return after deletion.
- If the request method is **POST**, the object is **deleted**, a success message is displayed, and the user is redirected.
- Otherwise, it renders the **delete confirmation page** where the user can confirm or cancel the deletion.

The complete code for the mentioned view is shown below at a glance:

```python
...

@login_required(login_url="login-view")
def digit_delete(request, pk):
  
    digit = DigitPic.objects.get(id = pk)
  
    if request.GET.get("pk") == None:
        back = reverse(request.GET.get("back"))
    else:
        back = reverse(request.GET.get("back"), kwargs={'pk': request.GET.get("pk")})
  
    if request.method == "POST":
        digit.delete()
        messages.success(request, "Object was successfully deleted.")
        return redirect("digit-detector-welcome")
  
    context = {
        "object": digit.title,
        "back": back,
    }
  
    return render(request, "delete-object-model.html", context)

...
```
