### Build a REAL Project

We wont just be learning the basics, we will be applying what we know to add awesome *site features like:* **messaging other users**, **leaving comments, rating projects** and **so much more**.

### Why Django?

1. Scale easily with Django for high traffic websites. This is one of its most popular features. Including built in tools to help you get your site to market fast.
2. Security is a priority when building any website. Django is used by top brands for this reason. It contains *built in* security features: SQL injection, cross-site request forgery, and cross-site scripting.
3. Easily customizable and versatile for any website and company size.
4. One of Djangos likable features is the community support. You can join forums and Facebook groups for connections and resources.

### Django helped me build and sell my first website for $41k

I was searching for a Python framework that would help me build a lab management system (that I then sold to my boss - watch the full story on YouTube: Dennis Ivy - *How I Sold My Python/Django Website for $41,000*). I started with Flask, but all it had was a server setup and everything else I would have to figure out on my own. Then I discovered Django...

It provided me with ALL the tools. Everything from authentication to a templating engine to a great package for a rest API. Added bonus: they have great community support around it and great infrastructure. I didn't have to worry that it wasnâ€™t scalable, **If it was good enough for YouTube, Spotify, Instagram and all the behemoth of machines, I knew that it would never be an issue for me.** One of the best features about Django is that it has a built in dashboard. You can run one command and already start seeing your data and modify it. This helped me get the site up and running quicker than expected.

### F.A.Q

**Q:** Will I have support throughout this course?
**A:** Unfortunately, with over 50k students across all platforms and a full time job, the teacher cannot offer individual help beyond the course itself. You can join the Discord group for additional support from fellow students.

**Q:** Is the course up to date?
**A:** Yes this course is currently up to date and compatible with Django 5.0.

**Q:** Will I always have access to this course when I purchase it?
**A:** Yes this course will always be up and hosted on Udemy.
